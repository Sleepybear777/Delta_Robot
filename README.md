# DRC - Delta robot controller:
A robot controller that computes the necessary degrees for each joint to reach a 3D coordinate in a cartesian space.
DRC can be used for any custom 3 DOF delta robot with servo motors supports the Arduino framework.
DRC is written in C++, uses the PlatformIO IDE and Arduino framework.
## Freatures:
* Cartesian coordinate conversion to joint degrees.
*
